<h1>Stock Watchlist</h1>

I've created a comprehensive stock watchlist website using HTML, CSS, React, and the AlphaVantage API. This project features a user-friendly search filter that allows users to easily find stock prices by entering the stock's name in the search bar. Additionally, there is an "Add" button that enables users to add stocks to their watchlist, and a corresponding "Remove" function to remove stocks from the watchlist. To ensure that the watchlist data remain even when the page is refreshed, I've implemented local storage for data storage and retrieval.

<h2>How does it Work</h2>

<li>Company Name Search: Users can enter the name of a company in the search bar.</li>
<li>Real-time API Data: The website fetches real-time stock data from the AlphaVantage API and displays it in the frontend user interface.</li>
<li>Add and Remove Stocks: Users have the ability to add companies to their watchlist and remove them as needed.</li>
<li>Empty Search Alert: If a user tries to search without entering a company name, an alert message is triggered to prompt the user to input a valid company name.</li>
<li>Real-time Search Results: Users receive instant and up-to-date search results for the entered company name.</li>
